      When you create a new wallet, a new RaiBlocks seed will be generated which can be used to create brand new accounts
      on the RaiBlocks network.  Your RaiBlocks seed is the master key to all of your accounts and by proxy any money inside of them!

      <p>Make sure you back up your seed, write it down, and keep it incredibly safe!  There is NO way to recover it after

      If you already have a RaiBlocks wallet, you can use your backup seed to import it below.  When you import an existing wallet,
      we create a new wallet and attach your seed to it.  None of your existing wallets or accounts are affected, and your seed
      is not stored anywhere besides in your local client.<br>
      <br>
      After importing your wallet, you will need to 're-create' your accounts.  Don't worry - all of your accounts are
      the same and your funds have not disappeared.  Just go to the accounts section and press create new account to load
      your existing accounts.
